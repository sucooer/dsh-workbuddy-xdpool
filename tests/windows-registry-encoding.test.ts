/**
 * Regression tests for Windows registry paths that contain non-ASCII characters.
 *
 * The reported defect: the plugin read `reg.exe` output with `encoding: 'utf8'`,
 * but reg.exe writes with the ACTIVE CONSOLE CODE PAGE — 936/GBK on a Chinese
 * Windows. A path containing 「腾讯」 therefore arrived as `��Ѷ`, every
 * `existsSync` failed, and the plugin concluded no desktop app was installed
 * while the app was installed, running, and holding a perfectly good credential.
 * The only workaround was an env override; there was no way to notice the cause
 * from the UI, and the log line named no path.
 *
 * The fix has two layers, and both are covered here:
 *   1. read the registry through PowerShell (`Get-ItemProperty` uses the
 *      registry API, so no code page is involved at all) — the primary path;
 *   2. keep a `reg.exe` reader as a fallback, but decode its bytes with
 *      encoding DETECTION validated against the filesystem, instead of
 *      assuming UTF-8.
 *
 * These tests need the real Windows registry and a real filesystem, so they are
 * skipped elsewhere rather than faked: a mocked registry would not have the
 * encoding layer that is the entire subject.
