English | [中文](./README.md)

Every account you've signed into the WorkBuddy desktop app, merged into one DSH model pool. However many accounts you've used, that's how many the pool holds — no forms, no manual import.

An account gets rate-limited or runs out of credits? The request just moves to the next one that works. You keep asking; it keeps handling the rest.

**It also throws in a full points-automation suite**: check-ins, task rewards, streak redemption, the buddy trip — all the chores you'd otherwise click through every day, done in the background.

> **How this differs from the single-account connectors**: plugins like `dsh-workbuddy-connect` handle one account at a time. XD Pool treats **multiple accounts as the normal case** — it doesn't pick favourites or ask you to import anything. Every sign-in snapshot on this machine goes into one shared pool, exposed as a single `workbuddy-xdpool` provider group, with automatic failover inside.

## Features

### 1. The multi-account pool

- **Zero config**: install it, turn it on, done. Every account signed into the WorkBuddy desktop app is discovered and pooled automatically — nothing to enter by hand.

- **Automatic failover**: the pool tracks each account's rate-limit state. Hit a 429 and that account cools down while later requests land on the next healthy one; it rejoins automatically once the cooldown ends. Requests only wait when every account is cooling.

- **Pool health at a glance**: the card shows how many accounts there are, how many are cooling, which one is next, plus each account's token expiry and cooldown countdown.

- **Live credit balances**: per-account credit packages (`package · remaining / total`) with a large total, refreshed from upstream as it changes.

- **An annotated model catalog**: pool models with their credit multiplier (e.g. `GLM-5.2 · x0.79`), free / limited-free / night-discount tags, image-input support and context window — all tracking upstream live.

- **CN / global auto-detection**: the upstream origin is picked per account from its login domain — a global sign-in (`workbuddy.ai`) goes to `www.workbuddy.ai`, CN (the default) to `copilot.tencent.com`. Both kinds can live in the same pool.

- **Manual controls when you want them**: re-detect accounts, clear all cooldowns, and daily check-in — on the card and in the CLI.

### 2. Points automation

One switch on the card, and the plugin works through your growth-centre routine for you. **On by default, and you can hit "Run now" to force a pass whenever you like.**

Five jobs:

| Job | Default time | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily check-in | 09:00 | Collect today's check-in reward |
| Activity report | 10:00 | Report activity so the growth centre counts the day |
| Task rewards | 11:00 | Enrol in open tasks and collect every reward that's ready |
| Streak bonus | 12:00 | Redeem streak tiers and spend the lottery draws |
| Buddy trip | 09:00 · 21:00 | Send the cat out, collect it when it's back |

**The task-rewards pass covers 13 board tasks**, including the ones that read as "somebody has to sit at the desktop and click these menus":

> Browse inspiration · Use 5 templates · Try a hot skill · Apply the "Peacekeeper Elite" theme · Read the library · Summon 5 experts · Summon 3 expert teams · Try the Tencent Lighthouse expert · Open any assistant app · Enter the QQ teacher assistant · Create a design canvas · Create a scheduled task · Chat with the cat

Measured across four accounts, one pass collected **3300 credits and 135 energy**.

**The card tells you what a pass actually collected** — it lists the task names rather than reporting a bare count. The streak countdown is spelled out too ("7d in 4d"), so a locked tier doesn't look like a failure.

**"Earned today"** breaks the day down by source — task rewards, check-in, streak, buddy trip — and resets at midnight.

**Credit floor per account**: set a minimum balance and an account below it stops being given work, so you can keep some credits in reserve.

> **The global region doesn't show this panel** — that gateway has no growth system at all.

## Install

Prerequisite: the WorkBuddy desktop app installed and signed in (the plugin reuses the sign-in state it stores locally). Multi-account = sign in and out a few times in the desktop app; each sign-in is absorbed into the pool. Built against DSH Desktop host `0.1.2`.

> Compatible with the `0.1.1-rc.2` / `0.1.2` host line: the settings section installs via `settings.installSection` (0.1.2-rc.1+) or the earlier free-function form, whichever the host supports.

**Option A — install from npm (recommended)**

```sh
# if dsh is not on PATH, use node ~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js instead
dsh plugin --profile desktop add @anyaer/dsh-workbuddy-xdpool
```

> npm is the fast path: the only dependency pulled in is the plugin itself (**roughly 1 package, a few seconds**).
> Installing from the GitHub source drags in the dev dependencies (bundler, test runner, hundreds of packages) and is much slower.

**Option B — install from the GitHub source**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop add github:sucooer/dsh-workbuddy-xdpool
```

**Option C — register the bundle by hand**

```sh
# 1) install the package (npm or GitHub)
dsh plugin --profile desktop add @anyaer/dsh-workbuddy-xdpool

# 2) register the bundle: edit ~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/package.json and append
#    "@anyaer/dsh-workbuddy-xdpool" to the end of the "dsh" → "profile" → "bundles" array

# 3) restart DSH Desktop
```

**Building locally (developers)**

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build              # produces lib/index.js + lib/index.d.ts + lib/bin.js + lib/client.js
pnpm test               # 138 tests
pnpm typecheck          # host side
pnpm typecheck:client   # client side
```

> **The build output is committed** (`lib/` is not gitignored), so a GitHub install needs no install-time script and never trips pnpm's "build scripts were blocked" prompt. **After changing `src/`, re-run `pnpm build` and commit `lib/` too** — otherwise users get the old build.

> Note: `pnpm install` wants pnpm 11 (`npx pnpm@11`), and may need `--config.confirmModulesPurge=false --config.minimumReleaseAge=0` — pnpm 11's default `minimumReleaseAge` supply-chain policy blocks just-published rc packages.

Once installed: a **WorkBuddy XD Pool** group appears in the model picker, and Settings → Plugins → **DSH WorkBuddy XD Pool** shows pool health, each account's token / credits / check-in / cooldown state, the "Detect accounts again" and "Clear all cooldowns" buttons, and a check-in button per account.

It also works under the Web / TUI profiles (`--profile web` / `--profile dsh-tui`).

## CLI

All commands run through `dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool <subcommand>`:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool status    # pool accounts/cooldown + shim state (--credits, --json, --rates)
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool accounts  # discovered accounts (--json)
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool doctor    # diagnose discovery/cooldown/upstream
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool reset     # clear all 429 cooldowns now
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool checkin   # today's check-in state per account (--json)
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool checkin all
                                                                 # collect every account's daily reward (or pass one label)
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool login     # guide to adding another desktop account
```

## How accounts get into the pool

Auto-discovery. Every sign-in on the WorkBuddy desktop app leaves a token-bearing snapshot; XD Pool scans them and absorbs each into the pool. So multi-account = sign in / switch accounts in the desktop app, then hit "Detect accounts again" or restart DSH.

To snapshot an extra login explicitly (e.g. to pin one account for verification):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool import myKey
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool accounts
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool remove myKey
```

Snapshots are stored under `~/.dsh/.workbuddy-xdpool/` named by the **MD5-8 prefix** of their key (so keys with Chinese, `/`, or spaces are safe). Long-lived use relies on refresh-token auto-renewal; if it lapses, re-sign-in on the desktop and `import <key> --force`.

## Configuration

Effective config is read from the plugin settings section (`settings.workbuddy-xdpool`), editable on the Models settings page and applied live:

| Field | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authFile` | Override the WorkBuddy desktop auth-file path (equiv. to `WORKBUDDY_AUTH_FILE`) | auto-probed |
| `cooldownMs` | Per-account 429 cooldown in milliseconds | `60000` |

Or set it directly in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
workbuddy-xdpool:
  cooldownMs: 120000
```

## Architecture

- **Host side** (`src/`, inside the DSH main process)
  - `index.ts` — registers the `workbuddy-xdpool` provider, the `workbuddy-xdpool` settings section, the same-origin routes (status / re-scan / clear cooldowns / check-in / automation run / credit reserve), plus account discovery and catalog seeding.
  - `accounts.ts` — `WorkBuddyAccountPool`: reads the desktop auth snapshots, 429 cooldowns, rotation and token refresh; account disabling and credit reserves live here too.
  - `scheduler.ts` — the points-automation scheduler: runs five jobs on local time points (check-in / report / tasks / streak / travel), persists the daily earnings ledger, and backs the card's "Run now" button with the same code path.
  - `task-events.ts` — builds the 13 task event chains. Each chain is plain data plus the fingerprint channel it must go out on (desktop or web); the tasks that need a REAL conversation (skill, experts) open one here to get the server-side id.
  - `catalog.ts` / `upstream.ts` — the upstream client: model catalog (with per-model multipliers and free / image tags), credits, check-in, and every automation endpoint, switching CN/global by credential domain.
  - `web-status.ts` / `status-paths.ts` — the same-origin status document and routes the card reads. Mutations are gated on POST + loopback origin + an explicit `accountId`.
  - `bin.ts` — the CLI above.
- **Client** (`src/client/`, the browser card loaded via `dsh.client`)
  The collapsible shell reuses the host's `dsm-plugin-card*` style language (`--dsw-alias-*` theme tokens); content classes are namespaced `dsm-workbuddy-xdpool-*`, and copy lives under the `settings.workbuddy-xdpool` namespace.
- **Build**
  `tsdown` produces `lib/index.js` (host entry) + `lib/index.d.ts` (types) + `lib/bin.js` (CLI) + `lib/client.js` (CJS browser bundle wrapped in `window.__ModuleLoader__.load`). All four are committed, so an install needs no build-time script.

## Known limitations

- **Only accounts on THIS machine's desktop app**: the pool cannot — and will not — sign you in or scan a QR code (tokens are minted by the WorkBuddy desktop app's own Tencent SSO and bound to the device). Adding an account = signing in on the desktop app; XD Pool absorbs it.

- **A few automation tasks are deliberately not implemented**
  - `Expert_Philanthropy` (charity expert): requires a real donation; there is no way around it.
  - `black_cat` (night owl): only scores between 23:00 and 08:00, and pays **no credits** — all-nighters for nothing.
  - `Model_chat_GLM5.2` (chat with a specific model) and `wb_wechat_oa_subscribe_task` (follow the official account): the path is mapped out, deferred to the next release.

- **`Expert_team_use_3` occasionally sticks at 2/3**: on one account, after two expert teams had been used that day, the third would not register (using a different, unused team didn't help either). Suspected per-account daily quota that resets the next day, unconfirmed. **Fresh accounts are unaffected** (measured 0/3 → 3/3).

- **Depends on WorkBuddy's client APIs** (not an official public API), so a WorkBuddy update may require a matching plugin update. If an account's refresh token lapses, sign in again on the desktop.

- If your Windows and Linux usernames differ and the Windows environment variable doesn't reach WSL, point `WORKBUDDY_AUTH_FILE` (or `authFile`) at the real location.
